# AndersonWeir2020_Amnat

This repository contains the code and data required for model performance analyses and worked examples from Anderson and Weir (2020), Am Nat, 196: 429-442. 

That paper (Anderson and Weir 2020) introduces a framework for testing for statistical signatures of divergent adaptation (i.e. adaptation caused by divergent selection) in patterns of trait differences in sets of lineage pairs (i.e. sets of sister species and other paired lineages). 

We used simulation to test model performance. Code for model performance simulations and analyses are found in AW2020_model_perf.R

We also fit the models to previously published datasets in a set of worked examples. Published data required for these analyses are in lawson_weir14_bodysize.csv, lawson_weir14_climate.csv, mammal_dna_tree.nex, mammal_size.csv. Code for running worked examples is in AW2020_worked_example.R.
